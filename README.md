# Call your React components

As simple as `window.confirm()` but in React:

<table>
<tr>
<td>window.confirm</td>
<td>react-call</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```tsx
const message = 'Sure?'
const yes = window.confirm(message)

if (yes) doCrazyStuff()
```

</td>
<td>

```tsx
const props = { message: 'Sure?' }
const yes = await Confirm.call(props)

if (yes) doCrazyStuff()
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

# Simple yet flexible

Present any piece of UI to the user, wait for the response data:

- üí¨ Confirmations, dialogs, form modals
- üîî Notifications, toasts, popups
- üìã Context menus
- üéâ Or anything!

# Quick setup

```sh
npm install react-call
```

We'll setup a confirmation dialog, but you can setup any component to be callable.

## 1. ‚öõÔ∏è Declaration

```tsx
import { createCallable } from 'react-call'

interface Props { message: string }
type Response = boolean

export const Confirm = createCallable<Props, Response>(({ call, message }) => (
  <div role="dialog">
    <p>{message}</p>
    <button onClick={() => call.end(true)}>Yes</button>
    <button onClick={() => call.end(false)}>No</button>
  </div>
))
```

Along with your props, there is a special `call` prop containing the `end()` method, which you can use to finish the call and return a response. State, hooks and any other React features are totally fine too.

## 2. üì° Rooting

`<Root>` is what listens to every single call and renders it. Place it anywhere that is visible when making your calls, for instance in `App.tsx`:

```diff
+ <Confirm.Root />
//  ^-- it will render active calls
```

## 3. üéâ Enjoy

You're all done! Now you can do this anywhere in your codebase:

```tsx
//        ‚Üô response             props ‚Üò
const accepted = await Confirm.call({ message: 'Continue?' })
```

# Exit animations

To animate the exit of your component when `call.end()` is run, just pass the duration of your animation in milliseconds to createCallable as a second argument:

```diff
+ const UNMOUNTING_DELAY = 500

export const Confirm = createCallable<Props, Response>(
  ({ call }) => (
    <div
+     className={call.ended ? 'exit-animation' : '' }
    />
  ),
+ UNMOUNTING_DELAY
)
```

The `call.ended` boolean may be used to apply your animation CSS class.

# Passing Root props

You can also read props from Root, which are separate from the call props. To do that, just add your RootProps type to createCallable and pass them to your Root.

Root props will be available to your component via `call.root` object.

```diff
+ type RootProps = { userName: string }

export const Confirm = createCallable<
  Props,
  Response,
+ RootProps
>(({ call, message }) => (
  ...
+   Hi {call.root.userName}!
  ...
))
```

```diff
<Confirm.Root
+ userName='John Doe'
/>
```

You may want to use Root props if you need to:

- Share the same piece of data to every call
- Use something that is availble in Root's parent
- Update your active call components on data changes

# FAQ

## What if more than one call is active?

`<Root>` works as a call stack. Multiple calls will render one after another (newer below, which is one on top of the other if your CSS is position fixed/absolute).

## Can I place more than one Root?

No. There can only be one `<Root>` mounted per createCallable(). Avoid placing it in multiple locations of the React Tree loaded at once, an error will be thrown if so.

# TypeScript types

You won't need them most likely, but if you want to split the component declaration and such, you may use the types under the `ReactCall` namespace:

```tsx
import type { ReactCall } from 'react-call'
```

Type | Description
--- | ---
ReactCall.Function<Props?, Response?> | The call() method
ReactCall.Context<Props?, Response?, RootProps?> | The call prop in UserComponent
ReactCall.Props<Props?, Response?, RootProps?> | Your props + the call prop
ReactCall.UserComponent<Props?, Response?, RootProps?> | What is passed to createCallable
ReactCall.Callable<Props?, Response?, RootProps?> | What createCallable returns

# Errors

Error | Solution
--- | ---
No \<Root> found! | You forgot to place the Root, check [Place the Root](#2--place-the-root) section. If it's already in place but not present by the time you call(), you may want to place it higher in your React tree. If you're getting this error on the server see [SSR section](#does-the-setup-work-with-ssr).
Multiple instances of \<Root> found! | You placed more than one Root, check [Place the Root](#2--place-the-root) section as there is a warning about this.

# SSR

‚úÖ The react-call setup supports [Server Side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering). This means both createCallable and Root component are fine if run or rendered on the server.

However, bear in mind that because the call() method is meant to be triggered by user interaction, it is designed as a client-only feature.

> [!CAUTION]
> If call() is run on the server a "No \<Root> found!" error will be thrown. As long as you don't run the call() method on the server you'll be fine.
